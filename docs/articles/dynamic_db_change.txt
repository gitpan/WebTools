Dynamic change of database
--------------------------

 WebTools has centralized configuration system and after its installation, 
commonly you also make database configuration, i.e. make DB user and webtools db structure.
So when this work is done programmer can run scripts and work with this system.
Preferred database is MySQL, but how you may know WebTools has build-in Flat DB support
and when you want to port your scripts to other PC (with installed WebTools) you can
almost in any case to relay on Flat DB engine. That's mean that you can write your
scripts with Flat DB. However current/active configuration on 'foreign' computer may be
set to MySQL. That can be a big problem because your scripts use Flat DB instead of MySQL.
To solve this problem your scripts can set 'temporary' database to Flat DB and change default
settings without physically change of config.pl At the end of work with Flat DB you
can still use default DB driver.

Example:

<?perl 
 # We assume, that WebTools is configured with MySQL database

 load_database_driver('flat');        # Load Flat DB driver

 $webtools::db_support = 'db_flat';   # Mark 'flat' as default DB driver 

 # Change default values for: $webtools::projectname, $webtools::sql_user,
 # $webtools::sql_pass, $webtools::sql_database_sessions, 
 # $webtools::sql_sessions_table, $webtools::sql_user_table ... and so on...

 $db = sql_connect();  # Connect to Flat DB
 sql_query("Some SQL query to Flat DB",$db);

 $webtools::db_support = 'db_mysql';  # Come back to MySQL DB.
 load_database_driver('mysql');       # Load 'mysql' driver

 # Return default values for: $webtools::projectname,
 # $webtools::sql_user, $webtools::sql_pass and so on...

 # At this point you can continue to use your default DB.
?>

 At this simple script you see, how you can change dynamicly configuration of webtools
without need to modify config.pl 

Note: These features were entred with WebTools ver 1.21, 1.22

Example: $webtools::sql_user = 'my_db_user';
